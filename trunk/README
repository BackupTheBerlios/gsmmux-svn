GSM 07.10 Driver Implementation with pseudo-tty's

Based on the work of Tuukka Karvonen, (see README.orig) and hacked to work
with pseudo-tty's instead.

This is far from complete. Please refer to README.orig for more information
about the GSM07.10 implementation.
I have removed all hardware handshaking stuff. It needs to be redone.
This version works well with the Sony-Ericsson GM47/GM48 module.
